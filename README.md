## Welcome to My webpage!

I am a 3rd year Ph.D. candidate in Economics at the University of Houston. I am interested in applied micro and econometrics. My current research is focused on  the neighborhood effects on birth weights.     

Obviously, I will not be attending the 2020 ASSA meeting in San Diego.

Learning html is quite difficult lol
